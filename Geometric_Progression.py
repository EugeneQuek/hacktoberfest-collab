# Write a function that determines if a list of integers follows a geometric progression
# Test your function with the following lists:
# list1 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
# list2 = [3, 6, 12, 24, 48]



# *Bonus* Write a function that makes use of the previous function and returns the sum to infinity of a geometric progression if it exists
# Test your function with the following lists:
# list3 = [625, 125, 25, 5, 1]
